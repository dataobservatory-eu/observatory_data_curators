description: If open data is the new gold, why even those who release fail to reuse
  it?   We created an open collaboration of data curators and open-source developers
  to dig into novel open data sources or increase the usability of existing ones.  We
  turn reproducible research software into research- as-service.

# Big Data for All {-}

**We want to ensure that individual researchers, artists, and professionals, as well as NGOs and small and large organizations can benefit equally from big data in the age of artificial intelligence.** 

Big data creates inequality and injustice because it is only the big corporations, big government agencies, and the biggest, best endowed universities that can finance long-lasting, comprehensive data collection programs. Big data, and large, well-processed, tidy, and accurately imputed datasets allow them to unleash the power of machine learning and AI. These large entities are able to create algorithms that decide the commercial success of your product and your artwork, giving them a competitive edge against smaller competitors while helping them evade regulations.

We are looking for partners to develop our [technological solution](#app) in a [financially sustainable way](service), bringing increasingly relevant [curated](#data-curators) open data [to light](#open-data). Our Product/Market Fit was validated in the world’s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). We are currently developing this project with the help of the [JUMP European Music Market Accelerator](https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellow2021/automated-music-observatory/) program.

## How We Add Value To Your Data? {- #data-value-added}

Many countries in the world allow access to a vast array of information, such as documents under freedom of information requests and national statistics figures and datasets. In the European Union, most taxpayer-financed data can be accessed and reused in domains such as government administration, transportation, or meteorology, for example. More and more scientific output is expected to be reviewable and reproducible, implying open access.

- In the \@ref(open-data). [Open Data](#open-data) chapter we investigate the reasons for which not even organizations such as the European Commission use open data in their own data dissemination practices, even though their data is at least legally available. The idea of open data is that it can reduce your material data costs, because it gives you access to data that was created at your tax expense by governmental agencies or universities. The main problem with *open data* is that while it is legally accessible, and often cost-free, in most cases it is not discoverable, and not even accessible directly. While since 2003 the EU has approved policies around making taxpayer-funded data reusable, it did not make much technical steps to make this a reality. Reusability of governmental data and scientific data is a right, but not a practical possiblity for most users.

- In the \@ref(FAIR-data). [FAIR Data and the Added Value of Rich Metadata](#FAIR-data) we introduce how we apply the concept of [FAIR](#FAIR) (**f**indable, **a**ccessibe, **i**nteroperable, and **r**eusable digital assets) in our APIs. Metadata does not relate to material data acquistion costs, but in fact, it is even more important: it is responsible for industry non-billable hours or uncredited working hours in academia. Poor data documentation, lack of reproducible processing and testing logs, inconsistent use of currencies, keywords, and storing [messy data](#messy-data) make reusability impossible. Organizations pay many times for the same, repeated work, because these boring tasks, which often comprise of tens of thousands of microtasks, are neglected. Our solution creates automatic documentation and metadata for your own historical internal data or for acquisitions from data vendors. We apply the more general [Dublin Core](#Dublin-Core) and the more specific, mandatory and recommended values of [DataCite](#DataCite) for datasets -- these are new requirements in EU-funded research from 2021. But they are just the minimal steps, and there is a lot more to do to create a diamond ring from an uncut gem.

- In the \@ref(app). [Application: Automated Data Observatories](#app) chapter we provide further technical information about our application. We use open-source software and open data. The applications are hosted on the cloud resources of [Reprex](#reprex), an early-stage technology startup currently building a viable, open-source, open-data business model to create reproducible research products. Our development team works on an open collaboration basis. Our indicator R packages and our services are developed together with [rOpenGov](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/ropengov/).

- See \@ref(service). [Service Design and Business Case Development](#service) to understand our ideas around finding a suitable business model for data sharing, as well as collaborative research activities that share the exponential value added from data integration across various business, policy, and academic partners.

- In the \@ref(data-curators). [Data Curators](#data-curators) chapter we provide information for prospective curators. See also our [get inspired](#get-inspired) and [your first contribution](#first-contribution) subchapters.

## Big Data For All {-}

Machine learning and AI give a competitive edge to large companies and governments that can exploit it.  But training algorithms requires large quantities of uniformly-formatted, high quality data, and the deployment of algorithms comes with many potential side effects.

## Automated Data Observatories {- #data-observatory}

Our work is inspired by the open collaboration concept, a well-known principle in open source software development and reproducible science. Our goal is to make this agile project management methodology more inclusive, involving data curators and various institutional partners as part of a general approach. Based on our early-stage startup, Reprex, and the open-source developer community rOpenGov, we are working together with other developers, data scientists, and domain specific data experts in climate change and mitigation, antitrust and innovation policies, and various aspects of the music and film industry.
