Big Data For All Automated Data Observatories", " Automated Observatory Contributors Handbook Daniel Antal, CFA 2021-07-07 Big Data for All We want to ensure that individual researchers, artists, and professionals, as well as NGOs and small and large organizations can benefit equally from big data in the age of artificial intelligence. Big data creates inequality and injustice because it is only the big corporations, big government agencies, and the biggest, best endowed universities that can finance long-lasting, comprehensive data collection programs. Big data, and large, well-processed, tidy, and accurately imputed datasets allow them to unleash the power of machine learning and AI. These large entities are able to create algorithms that decide the commercial success of your product and your artwork, giving them a competitive edge against smaller competitors while helping them evade regulations. We are looking for partners to develop our technological solution in a financially sustainable way, bringing increasingly relevant curated open data to light. Our Product/Market Fit was validated in the worlds 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab. We are currently developing this project with the help of the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator program. How We Add Value To Your Data? Many countries in the world allow access to a vast array of information, such as documents under freedom of information requests and national statistics figures and datasets. In the European Union, most taxpayer-financed data can be accessed and reused in domains such as government administration, transportation, or meteorology, for example. More and more scientific output is expected to be reviewable and reproducible, implying open access. We create high value key business and policy evaluation indicators.Scientific proofs require the combination of correctly matching, formatting, and verifying controlled pieces of data. Our data comes from verified and legal sources, with information about use rights and a complete history. We do not deal in blood diamonds. Adding metadata exponentially increases the value of data. Did your region add a new town to its boundaries? How do you adjust old data to conform to constantly changing geographic boundaries? What are some practical ways of combining satellite sensory data with my organizations records? And do I have the right to do so? Metadata logs the history of data, providing instructions on how to reuse it, also setting the terms of use. We automate this labor-intensive process applying the FAIR data concept. Data is only potential information, raw and unprocessed. How do I correctly convert between dollars and euros? How do I verify consistency in units of measurement? Some of our indicators go through more than 10,000 processing steps. If your team does this in a spreadsheet or statistical software, there is no way it will be faultless  or that senior staff can verify it. DatacurationData sits everywhere: in every government data warehouse (you can reuse it!), scientific journals, libraries, your sales records, and in sensors, to name a few. Not having access to data due to budgetary or legal constraints is an absolute barrier, and being unable to correctly assemble it into reliable information can keep its value low. In the 1. Open Data chapter we investigate the reasons for which not even organizations such as the European Commission use open data in their own data dissemination practices, even though their data is at least legally available. The idea of open data is that it can reduce your material data costs, because it gives you access to data that was created at your tax expense by governmental agencies or universities. The main problem with open data is that while it is legally accessible, and often cost-free, in most cases it is not discoverable, and not even accessible directly. While since 2003 the EU has approved policies around making taxpayer-funded data reusable, it did not make much technical steps to make this a reality. Reusability of governmental data and scientific data is a right, but not a practical possiblity for most users. In the 2. FAIR Data and the Added Value of Rich Metadata we introduce how we apply the concept of FAIR (findable, accessibe, interoperable, and reusable digital assets) in our APIs. Metadata does not relate to material data acquistion costs, but in fact, it is even more important: it is responsible for industry non-billable hours or uncredited working hours in academia. Poor data documentation, lack of reproducible processing and testing logs, inconsistent use of currencies, keywords, and storing messy data make reusability impossible. Organizations pay many times for the same, repeated work, because these boring tasks, which often comprise of tens of thousands of microtasks, are neglected. Our solution creates automatic documentation and metadata for your own historical internal data or for acquisitions from data vendors. We apply the more general Dublin Core and the more specific, mandatory and recommended values of DataCite for datasets  these are new requirements in EU-funded research from 2021. But they are just the minimal steps, and there is a lot more to do to create a diamond ring from an uncut gem. In the 4. Application: Automated Data Observatories chapter we provide further technical information about our application. We use open-source software and open data. The applications are hosted on the cloud resources of Reprex, an early-stage technology startup currently building a viable, open-source, open-data business model to create reproducible research products. Our development team works on an open collaboration basis. Our indicator R packages and our services are developed together with rOpenGov. See 5. Service Design and Business Case Development to understand our ideas around finding a suitable business model for data sharing, as well as collaborative research activities that share the exponential value added from data integration across various business, policy, and academic partners. In the 6. Data Curators chapter we provide information for prospective curators. See also our get inspired and your first contribution subchapters. Big Data For All Machine learning and AI give a competitive edge to large companies and governments that can exploit it. But training algorithms requires large quantities of uniformly-formatted, high quality data, and the deployment of algorithms comes with many potential side effects. Trustworthy AIWe help deploying reliable AI that is under human supervision, and algorithms that will not turn against your organization, or engage in discriminative, unlawful, or counterproductive behavior. We automate data and metadata management, documentation, and verification, because computers are much better than humans in these laborious and often repetitive tasks; humans must increasingly focus on oversight of too much data. Open collaboration for data treasuresWe use the agile open collaboration project methodology of open source software development to make sure that large universities, consultancies, citizen scientists, individual artists, and small NGOs can share research budgets, data assets, and innovation in big data to remain competitive against big tech and large organizations. Data-as-Service.Most organizations cannot afford to build an in-house data science and data engineerong team, nor do they possess in-house market research or IT capabilities. Instead of burdening your team with manual data downloads and ad hoc data manipulation, we offer you subscription for curated open and proprietary processed data. We keep all your data assets tidy, documented, and easy to use. Automated Data Observatories Data sits everywhere: in every government data warehouse (you can reuse it!), scientific journals, libraries, your sales records, and in sensors, to name a few. Not having access to data due to budgetary or legal constraints is an absolute barrier, and being unable to correctly assemble it into reliable information can keep its value low. Our observatories are built around open collaborations between scientific, business, public, and NGO policy partners. Automated Data Observatories Our work is inspired by the open collaboration concept, a well-known principle in open source software development and reproducible science. Our goal is to make this agile project management methodology more inclusive, involving data curators and various institutional partners as part of a general approach. Based on our early-stage startup, Reprex, and the open-source developer community rOpenGov, we are working together with other developers, data scientists, and domain specific data experts in climate change and mitigation, antitrust and innovation policies, and various aspects of the music and film industry. The Green Deal Data Observatory is a modern reimagination of existing data observatories; currently, there are over 70 permanent international data collection and dissemination points known as data observatories. One of our objectives is to understand why the dozens of the EUs observatories do not use open data and reproducible research. We want to show that open governmental data, open science, and reproducible research can lead to higher quality and a faster data ecosystem that fosters growth for policy, business, and academic data users.

The Digital Music Observatory (DMO) is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that creates public datasets to provide a comprehensive view of the European music industry. It provides high-quality and timely indicators in all four pillars of the planned official European Music Observatory as a modern, open source and largely open data-based, automated, API-supported alternative solution for this planned observatory. The insight and methodologies we are refining in the DMO are applicable and transferable to about 60 other data observatories funded by the EU which do not currently employ governmental or scientific open data.

The Competition Data Observatory is the first offspring of the Economy Data Observatory incubator. See further details in 10 Competition Data Observatory Chapter. We would like to create early-warning, risk, economic effect, and impact indicators that can be used in scientific, business and policy contexts for professionals who are working on re-setting the European economy after a devastating pandemic and in the age of AI. We would like to map data between economic activities (NACE), antitrust markets, and sub-national, regional, and metropolitan area data. See the prototype on the web. The Economy Data Observatory works now as an incubator for economy-focused data observatories.

"],["open-data.html", "1 Open Data 1.1 How We Add Value to Open Data 1.2 Research Automation", " 1 Open Data In the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019 / 1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the PSI Directive which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013. Open Data - The New Gold Without the Rush Open Data is Like Gold in the Mud Below the Chilly Waves of Mountain Rivers Poor quality, needs reprocessingOpen data quality is usually poor. You even need to reprocess datasets of statistical organizations or official data observatories. Undocumented, no reuse informationThe most open data is impossible to find or reuse because of the lacking administrative, descriptive and processing metadata. Data is only potential information, raw and unprocessed.Open data is always messy. If you make the many hundred, thousand, or ten thousand little steps to clear it manually, than your work will be error-prone, and very difficult for internal or external auditors to check. Data curationData sits in every government data warehouse (you can only legally reuse it), scientific repositories, libraries, your sales records, in sensors. Our automated data observatories help them bringing up to the sunlight. The EU has an 18-year-old open data regime, and it makes public taxpayer-funded data in the values of tens of billions of euros per year; the Eurostat program alone handles 20,000 international data products, including at least 5,000 pan-European environmental indicators. As open science principles gain increased acceptance, scientific researchers are making hundreds of thousands of valuable datasets public and available for replication every year. The EU, the OECD, and UN institutions run around 100 data collection programs, so-called data observatories that more or less avoid touching this data and buy proprietary data instead. Annually, each observatory spends between 50 thousand and 3 million EUR on collecting untidy and proprietary data of inconsistent quality, while never even considering open data. The problem with the current EU data strategy is that while it produces enormous quantities of valuable open data, in the absence of common basic data science and documentation principles, it seems often cheaper to create new data than to put the existing open data into shape. This is an absolute waste of resources and efforts. With a few R packages and our deep understanding of advanced data science techniques, we can create valuable datasets from unprocessed open data. In most domains, we can repurpose data originally created for other purposes at a historical cost of several billions of euros, converting these unused data assets into valuable datasets that can replace tens of millions worth of proprietary data. What we want to achieve with this project  and we believe such an accomplishment would merit one of the first prizes - is to add value to a significant portion of pre-existing EU open data (for example, available on data.europa.eu/data) by re-processing and integrating them into a modern, tidy database with an API access, and to find a business model that emphasises a triangular use of data in 1. business, 2. science and 3. policy-making. Our mission is to modernize the concept of data observatories. 1.1 How We Add Value to Open Data While the EU announces every year that again billions and billions of worth data became open again, this is not gold. At least not in the form of nicely minted gold coins, but in gold dust and nuggets found in the muddy banks of chilly rivers. There is no rush for it, because panning out its value requires plenty of hard work. We are trying to automate this work to make open data useable at scale, even in trustworthy AI solutions. Most open data is not public, it is not downloadable from the Internet  in the EU parlance, open only means a legal entitlement to get access to it. And even in the rare cases when data is open and public, often it is mired by data quality issues. We are working on the prototypes of a data-as-serve and research-as-service built with open-source statistical software that taps into various and often neglected open data sources. We are in a prototype phase in June, but we hope that we will have a well-functioning service by the time of the conference, because we are working only with open-source software elements; our technological readiness level is already very high. The novelty of our process is that we are trying to further develop and integrate a few open-source technology items into a technologically and financially sustainable data-as-service and even research-as-service solutions. We decided to take a new, modern approach to the data observatory concept, and modernize it with the application of 21st century data and metadata standards, the new results of reproducible research and data science. See 5. Service Design and Business Case Development 1.2 Research Automation Our curators help finding the best available information source. This is often open data, which is not equal to public data. Open data is a governmental or scientific data source which you can legally access. It is almost never available for direct download and requires much processing. You could probably do this in Excel - if the data were not in various sql, pdf, sav, csv, tsv, xls and various other file formats. We process the data: Yes, anybody can convert from millions of euros to euros in a spreadsheet, tons to kilograms, maybe even ounces to grams, but many unit conversions are error-prone if done by humans. Not everybody can make valid currency translations (When do I use year-end USD/EUR rate? Todays EUR/GBP? Or GBP/EUR? Annual average rate?) We do this processing in a way that conforms to the tidy data definition, which allows easy integration, joining, and importing of data into your database. While the unit conversions can be automated in Excel or PowerBI, the data tidying requires a more programatic approach. Quality control: Our data goes through dozens of computer logical checks (Do assets and liabilities match? Do dollar and euro amounts lead to the same result?) Our algorithms go through automated and human statistical peer-review, and are open to your experts for checking, because transparency and openness allow for the best quality control. This unit testing is not really possible in Excel or Power BI, not to mention the senior supervision of such tasks. To maintain data integrity, we place an authoritative copy with a digital object identifier in the Zenodo scientific data repository. We place both our algorithms and our methods into peer-reviewed scientific publications, and our data products are checked and improved by competent experts in the field. We produce the data and its visualization in easy to reuse, machine-readable, platform-independent formats. Just like that, csv, json, jpg, png, doxc, epub, pdf, pptx, odt, sav, you name it, we do it. Reproducible research is a scientific concept that can be applied to a wide range of professional designations, such as accounting, finance or the legal profession. We are applying this concept to Evidence-based, Open Policy Analysis and Professional Standards in Business, including, for example, reproducible finance in the investment process or reproducible impact assessment in policy consulting. Based on computational reproducibility we believe that the following principles should be followed: Reviewability means that our applications results can be assessed and judged by our users experts, or experts they trust. Reproducibility means that we provide data products and tools that allow the exact duplication of our results during assessments. This ensures that all logical steps can be verified. Confirmability means that using our applications findings leads to the same professional results as other available software and information. Our data products use the open-source statistical programming language R. We provide details about our algorithms and methodology to confirm our results in SPSS or Stata or sometimes even in Excel. Auditability means that our data and software is archived in a way that external auditors can later review, reproduce and confirm our findings. This is a stricter form of data retention than most organizations apply because we do not only archive results step-by-step but all computational steps  as if your colleagues would not only save every step in Excel but also their keystrokes. Read more about this topic here. 1.2.1 Reproducible Research Reproducible research is a scientific concept that can be applied to a wide range of professional designations.

This is a stricter form of data retention that most organizations apply because we do not only archive results step-by-step but all computational steps  as if your colleagues would not only save every step in Excel but also their keystrokes. While auditability is a requirement in accounting, we are extending this approach to all the quantitative work of a professional organization in an advisory or consulting capacity. Reviewable findings: The descriptions of the methods can be independently assessed, and the results judged credible. In our view, this is a fundamental requirement for all professional applications. CEEMIDs music data is used to settle royalty disputes in judicial procedures, or in grant and policy design. We believe that the future European Music Observatory should aim at the same bar, making its data &amp; research products open for challenges in the publicity of science, courts, and professional peers. Replicable findings: We are presenting our findings and provide tools so that our users or auditors or external authorities can duplicate our results. Confirmable findings: The main conclusions of the research can be obtained independently without our software because we describe in detail the algorithms and methodology in supplementary materials. We believe that other organizations, analysts, statisticians must come to the same findings with their own methods and software. This avoids lock-in and allows independent cross-examination. Auditable findings: Sufficient records (including data and software) have been archived so that the research can be defended later if necessary or differences between independent confirmations resolved. The archive might be private, as with traditional laboratory notebooks. See Open collaboration with academia, auditors, and industry. These computational requirements require a data workflow that relies on further principles. Record retention: all aspects of reproducibility require a high level of standardized documentation. The standardization of documentation requires the use of standardized metadata, metadata structures, taxonomies, vocabularies. Best available information / data universe: the quality of the findings, their confirmation and auditing success will improve with better data and facts used. Data validations: The quality of the findings will greatly depend on the factual inputs. While the reproducible findings may have many problems, inputting erroneous data or faulty information will likely lead to wrong conclusions, and in all cases will make confirmation and auditing impossible. Especially when organizations use large and heterogeneous data sources, even small errors, such as erroneous currency translations or accidental misuse of decimals, units can cause results that will not pass confirmation or auditing.

Can I practically combine satellite sensory data with my organization records? And do I have the right? Metadata logs the history of the data, gives instructions who to reuse it in indicators, sets the terms of use. We automate this boring and labor-intensive process applying the FAIR data concept. We provide you with polished data, or we process your uncut dataset diamonds to shape. We are providing a comprehensive, automated solution to problems that are not so much related to the data itself, but the information, documentation of the data, i.e. the metadata, and the structure how the data is stored. These problems create countless non-billable hours in professional services, or daunting extra work in research institutions that do not result in credited publications and other research output. These problems should be eliminated or handled by computers. We believe that the most value in our research automation comes from the documentation automation, which adds automatically rich descriptive, administrative and processing metadata to your data assets. Lack of clarity with respect to: - The legal consequences of reusing a dataset. Do licensing restriction apply? What are the correct attributions to creators, contributors, publishers? Who checked the reliability of the dataset? Did it change? It is unclear what is the content of a data file. Who used it, who controlled it, does it need further work? The description is missing or difficult to use. There are no systematic keywords applied to the files, data, and it is impossible to run a search on your computer that will deliver the right asset. Is this the latest verion of the dataset? Is there a new version available somewhere? Did somebody recast the data, did corrections take place? This can be particularly labor intensive to check if you use external data sources. The lack of reusability: - If you open a dataset, you need to make several moves with your mouse or apply several keystrokes (all error-prone and generate new supervisory, control taks) before you can start analyzing or visualizting the data. Generally, as soon as you need to use a mouse, plenty of new work and cost is generated. What are the units or currency rates used? Is the data expressed in euros, milions of euros? Do you need to translate dollars to euros on the average rate, the spot rate? What is the functional currency of the problem? The data cannot be easily imported, further processing is needed before you can add it a relational database. Tidy data can be imported without further work. The data has many versions in your organization. Corrections were not logged, and before using it or handing it over to a client, all verification processes must be repeated, even though they may have been done several times in the past. Potential mistakes during use: - Wrong currency translations, or wrong type of financial data merged. Annual, year end data divided by annual, middle of the year data. Accidentally units recorded in thousands of euros and euros are mixed up. During tidying a digit is entered accidentally to the keyboard. Or a field is erased. Some of these problems are controled by database schemas, but database schemas are rigid and most workers do not like to work with them. We use different schemas that are not as strict as schemas applied in databases, and we use automation software that applies these schemas to documents and data has been created by your colleagues in the past without reference to schemas. We apply instead the FAIR Data concept stands for findable, accessibe, interoperable, and reusable of digital assets, for example, when we re-create a missing codebook to a survey documentation that was carried out years ago. The problem with Open Data is that while it is legally accessible, and often cost-free, it in most cases not findable, and not even accessible directly. While the EU has policies since 2003 about making taxpayer funded data reusable, it did not make much technical steps to make this a reality. Reusability of governmental data and scientific data is a right, but not a practical possiblity for most users. The data may sit in various historical file formats, without documentation. Interoperability means that you can use governmental open data, scientific open data, your own systems data, your membership organizations shared resources, and data subscriptions together. A special case of lack of interoperability when you do not know if you are facing a legal risk from using a data resource. In our experience, in most research-driven organizations, such as consultancies, law firms, university research groups, NGOs and public policy bodies, reusability is mainly limited by poor data documentation, and sometimes by the use of of obsolete proprietary file formats. Documentation in the short run is not always a necessity, and it belongs to the non-billable hours, or among the tasks that do not really count in a researchers promotion. The poor documentation however makes it extremely demanding to re-use a data or document a few years from now. From 2021, if you apply for Horizon Europe funding, your research output must meet basic findability and reusability criteria. Our data comes with metadata that meets the requirements of two metadata standards, the more general Dublin Core and the more specific, mandatory and recommended values of DataCite for datasets. We go even further, we add rich processing metadata beyond these requirements. These are not only nice to have: from 2021, if you apply for Our solution can automate this process, and besides making you compliant, it adds a lot of value to your own data management. We are making our data-as-service APIs FAIR by automatically adding to our data standardized metadata that fulfills the mandatory requirements of the Dublic Core metadata standards and at the same time the mandatory requirements, and most of the recommended requirements of DataCite. Furthermore, we apply the tidy data concept to our partners data assets. The tidy data principle applies a certain structure to datasets that facilitates immediate use and reuse. 2.1 FAIR In 2016, the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship were published in Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasize machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data because of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data. A practical how to guidance to go FAIR can be found in the Three-point FAIRification Framework. Findable The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process. F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below) F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource Accessible Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation. A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available Interoperable The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data Reusable The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards The principles refer to three types of entities: data (or any digital object), metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure. For instance, principle F4 defines that both metadata and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource (the infrastructure component). 2.2 The Dublin Core See: Dublin Core Cross-Domain Attribute Set Contributor An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.

The Description property optional elements, and we adopted them as follows for the observatories: The Abstract is a short, textual description; we try to automate its creation as much as a possible, but some curatorial input is necessary. In the TechnicalInfo sub-field, we record automatically the utils::sessionInfo() for computational reproducability. This is automatically created by the dataobservatory R package. In the Other sub-field, we record the keywords for structuring the observatory. 2.3.2 Optional The Optional (O) properties are optional and provide richer description. For findability they are not so important, but to create a web service, they are essential. In the mandatory and recommended fields, we are following other metadata standards and codelists, but in the optional fields we have to build up our own system for the observatories. Language A language of the resource. (Dublin Core item.) Alternative Identifier An identifier or identifiers other than the primary Identifier applied to the resource being registered. Size We give the CSV, downloadable dataset size in bytes. Format We give file format information. We mainly use CSV and JSON, and occasionally rds and SPSS types. (Dublin Core item.) Version The version number of the resource. Rights We give SPDX License List standards rights description with URLs to the actual license. (Dublin Core item: Rights Management) Funding Reference We provide the funding reference information when applicable. This is usually mandatory with public funds. Related Item We give information about our observatory partners related research products, awards, grants (also Dublin Core item as Relation.) We particularly include source information when the dataset is derived from another resource (which is a Dublin Core item.) In the Language we only use English (eng) at the moment. By default We do not use the Alternative Identifier property. We will do this when the same dataset will be used in several observatories. The Size property is measured in bytes for the CSV representation of the dataset. During creations, the software creates a temporary CSV file to check if the dataset has no writing problems, and measures the dataset size. The Version property needs further work. For a daily re-freshing API we need to find an applicable versioning system. The Funding reference will contain information for donors, sponsors, and co-financing partners. Our default setting for Rights is the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license and we provide an URI for the license document. In the RelatedItem we give information about: The original (raw) data source. Methodological bibilography reference, when needed. The open-source statistical software code that processed the data. 2.4 Administrative Metadata Like with diamonds, it is better to know the history of a dataset, too. Our administrative metadata contains codelists that follow the SXDX statistical metadata standards, and similarly strucutred information about the processing history of the dataset. See for further reference The codebook Class. Observation Status SDMX Code list for Observation Status 2.2 (CL_OBS_STATUS), such as actual, missing, imputed, etc. values. Method If the value is estimated, we provide modelling information. Unit We provide the measurement unit of the data (when applicable.) Frequency SDMX Code list for Frequency 2.1 (CL_FREQ) frequency values Codelist Euros-SDMX Codelist entries for the observational units, such as sex, etc. Imputation SDMX Code list for Frequency 2.1 (CL_IMPUT_METH) imputation values Estimation The estimation methodology of data that we calculated, together with citation information and URI to the actual processing code Related Item We give information about the software code that processed the data (both Dublin Core and DataCite compliant.) See an example in the The codebook Class article of the dataobservatory R package. 2.5 An Example ## DataCite information for Population of Small European Countries ## # A tibble: 21 x 2 ## Property Value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 dataset_code &quot;small_population_total&quot; ## 2 Identifier &quot;small_population_total&quot; ## 3 Creator &quot;Joe, Doe&quot; ## 4 Title &quot;Population of Small European Countries&quot; ## 5 Publisher &quot;Reprex&quot; ## 6 PublicationYe~ &quot;2021&quot; ## 7 ResourceType &quot;Dataset&quot; ## 8 Subject &quot;Demography&quot; ## 9 Contributor &lt;NA&gt; ## 10 Date &quot;{\\&quot;Updated\\&quot;:[\\&quot;2021-07-07\\&quot;],\\&quot;EarliestObservation\\&quot;:[\\&quot;200~ ## # ... with 11 more rows The Description property has three mandatory elements: The Abstract is a short, textual description.

Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes. It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And its not just a first step, but it must be repeated many times over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected. The tidy data principle applies a certain structure to datasets that facilitates immediate use and reuse. The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organise data values within a dataset. A standard makes initial data cleaning easier because you dont need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time. Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure (. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data we need a way to describe the underlying semantics, or meaning, of the values displayed in the table: Every column is a variable. Every row is an observation. Every cell is a single value. 2.7 Messy data Real datasets can, and often do, violate the three precepts of tidy data in almost every way imaginable  this particulary true of open data, even when it is released by statistical bodies. The most typical errors: Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column, for example, the number of item purchased and the price of the item. Variables are stored in both rows and columns, for example, the columns are organized by income level groups. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. For example, names of musicians and their songs. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. While messy data almost always can be tidied, if you do this in a spreadsheet application manually, it is almost impossible not to make a mistake. Spreadsheet applications do not check the tidyness of the data, and do not record the logs of your manual tidying efforts. Unless every single mouseclick, drag and drop is recorded, the work is impossible to validate. However, we believe that data should never be manipulated with a mouse. Computer algorithms should be deployed in a way that our their tidying efforts are reproducible and logged. "],["trustworhty-ai.html", "3 Trustworthy AI", " 3 Trustworthy AI Trustworthy AIWe help deploying reliable AI that is under human supervision, and algorithms that will not turn against your organization, or engage in discriminative, unlawful, or counterproductive behavior. We automate data and metadata management, documentation, verification, because computers are much better than humans in these boring tasks; humans must increasingly focus on oversight of too much data. Human agency and oversight AI systems should empower human beings, allowing them to make informed decisions and fostering their fundamental rights. At the same time, proper oversight mechanisms need to be ensured, which can be achieved through human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, and human-in-command approaches Technical Robustness and safety AI systems need to be resilient and secure. They need to be safe, ensuring a fall back plan in case something goes wrong, as well as being accurate, reliable and reproducible. That is the only way to ensure that also unintentional harm can be minimized and prevented. Privacy and data governance besides ensuring full respect for privacy and data protection, adequate data governance mechanisms must also be ensured, taking into account the quality and integrity of the data, and ensuring legitimised access to data. Transparency the data, system and AI business models should be transparent. Traceability mechanisms can help achieving this. Moreover, AI systems and their decisions should be explained in a manner adapted to the stakeholder concerned. Humans need to be aware that they are interacting with an AI system, and must be informed of the systems capabilities and limitations. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness Unfair bias must be avoided, as it could have multiple negative implications, from the marginalization of vulnerable groups to the exacerbation of prejudice and discrimination. Fostering diversity, AI systems should be accessible to all, regardless of any disability, and involve relevant stakeholders throughout their entire life circle. Societal and environmental well-being AI systems should benefit all human beings, including future generations. They should consider the environment, including other living beings, and their social and societal impact should be carefully considered. Accountability Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for AI systems and their outcomes. "],["app.html", "4 Application: Automated Data Observatories 4.1 Data Acquisition and Processing 4.2 Data Integrity: Authoritative Copies 4.3 Automated Data Observatory API 4.4 Long form documentation 4.5 Front-End Websites 4.6 Research Automation", " 4 Application: Automated Data Observatories This years EU Datathlon includes three challenges. We are contesting all three of them with the same technology and knowledge management, but with different data used in a wide range of knowledge domains. 4.1 Data Acquisition and Processing We access various open governmental and open scientific sources programatically. Our programs are mainly written in the R language, but we have a growing body of software written in Python, too. We thrive to be open for both R and Python developers, and as much as possible, exploit the synergies between the more statistically oriented R language and the more general application-oriented Python. We welcome curators and developers in both languages. An important aspect of our quality control is that our processing code is open and peer-reviewed. Our observatories are turning the peer-reviewed statistical software of the rOpenGov community into a continuous data-as-service product. This means that we are creating collector software that is making reproducible data assets, mainly business and policy indicators. Then we are running this software daily in the cloud, and place the new data acquisitions authoritative copies into a scientific repository for data integrity purposes, then upload it to our API, describe it in our long form documentation, and eventually blog about the newsworthy finds on our Front-end Websites. The entire research automation system is maintained by Reprex, a Dutch research automation startup, in open collaboration with rOpenGov and other developers. 4.2 Data Integrity: Authoritative Copies We rely on a data repository to keep a final, authoritative copy of our data assets and visualizations. This repository is independent from us. Zenodo is a semi-endorsed EU solution, originating from CERN. In the last EU budget period all EU-funded research was supposed to deposit data there, although this requirement was not often enforced. Manual deposition is in working order, and we can very easily retrieve our own data in various versions. It is also free data storage. The Zenodo API is not very well documented, particularly for R. But it is supported both in Python and R. We have a tutorial and code on how to deposit our assets programatically via the Zen4R package. It is a bit difficult to use - it mimics true object-oriented programming relying on R6 classes, which is extremely rarely used by R programmers. The Dataverse is much better served, the API is better documented, and technically we could even set up our own instance (new dataverses can be installed.) The best instance is of course the original Harvard Dataverse. Currently Dataverse has no support on CRAN - the R package was just kicked out of CRAN, and it is buggy, but it can be fixed. Should there be a need, we can make a connector to Dataverse, too. 4.3 Automated Data Observatory API Our observatories APIs are Datasette instances. It is a lightweight, Python-based application that turns a SQLite database into a powerful API. Our developer, Botond Vitos manages our APIs. The indicator table contains the actual values, and the various estimated/imputed values of the indicator, clearly marking missing values, too. The descriptive metadata is contained in the description tables. The data transactional and processing metadata is contained in the metadata tables. The variable labelling and unit labelling information is stored in the labelling tables. Currently our APIs are re-freshed by an R code. We will soon add a Python collector, too. 4.4 Long form documentation Our long-form documentation is based on bookdown, which relies on pandoc, rmarkdown and knitr. This handbook is also created in bookdown. It is a very mature workflow, it produces a long-form website, and PDF, ePUB or Word versions from the API. The current automation is not operational, as we have recently included the API. 4.5 Front-End Websites Our observatorys client-facing front end is made by the static website generator hugo, which is programmed in the go language. We use the open-source Starter Hugo Academic template of wowchemy. If we win a price, well certainly offer them a share! The hugo-bookdown integration is partly supported by the R package blogdown. This is a semi-success, and while academic is a super-popular template, it is getting further and further away from blogdown. The original advantage is that it can be managed in the same workflow as the indicator generation, package documentation, the long-form documentation is a bit gone. 4.6 Research Automation Because every step of our data acquisition, processing, structuring, and testing is going through machines, it can be replicated any given year, month, day, or hour. Research automation means that we update our data every day (Is there new data at the source? Corrections? Known issues?) and place the current version in an API. Continous data collection: Big data sources usually provide the user with a large quantity of insignificant data. Because of the large quantity, the data is usually not available historically: you capture it today or it is gone. You need to process data in big quantities in order to find signficiant and meaningful information. Most small enterprises and research teams do not have the engineering capactity to organize this. We do continous data collection on all sources to capture the latest updates, or corrections. Focus on reusability: In our experience, the resuability of research and consulting work is greatly reduced by two factors, which we resolve with continous data collection and documentation: poor documentation (the bibliography updates and file descriptions are the least priortized tasks) data tables, charts, visualizations became dated then obsolete. From tidy and open data to data-as-service: Because all our assets, including key business indicators, policy indicators, scientific replication sets, and their visualizations, as well as maps, are created by open source and reproducible software, the software can run continously. Instead of providing our users with data tables, charts and maps, we provide them with a subsription to the latest data and its latest visualizations.

Various UN and OECD bodies, and particularly the European Union support or maintain more than 60 data observatories, or permanent data collection and dissemination points, but even these do not use these organizations and their members open data. We are building open-source data observatories, which run open-source statistical software that automatically processes and documents reusable public sector data (from public transport, meteorology, tax offices, taxpayer funded satellite systems, etc.) and reusable scientific data (from EU taxpayer funded research) into new, high quality statistical indicators. We are building open-source data observatories, which run open-source statistical software that automatically processes and documents reusable public sector data (from public transport, meteorology, tax offices, taxpayer funded satellite systems, etc.) and reusable scientific data (from EU taxpayer funded research) into new, high quality statistical indicators. We are building various open-source data collection tools in R and Python to bring up data from big data APIs and legally open, but not public, and not well served data sources. For example, we are working on capturing representative data from the Spotify API or creating harmonized datasets from the Eurobarometer and Afrobarometer survey programs. Open data is usually not public; whatever is legally accessible is usually not ready to use for commercial or scientific purposes. In Europe, almost all taxpayer funded data is legally open for reuse, but it is usually stored in heterogeneous formats, processed into an original government or scientific need, and with various and low documentation standards. Our expert data curators are looking for new data sources that should be (re-) processed and re-documented to be usable for a wider community. We would like to introduce our service flow, which touches upon many important aspects of data scientist, data engineer and data curatorial work. We believe that even such generally trusted data sources as Eurostat often need to be reprocessed, because various legal and political constraints do not allow the common European statistical services to provide optimal quality data  for example, on the regional and city levels. With rOpenGov and other partners, we are creating open-source statistical software in R to re-process these heterogenous and low-quality data into tidy statistical indicators to automatically validate and document it. We are carefully documenting and releasing administrative, processing, and descriptive metadata, following international metadata standards, to make our data easy to find and easy to use for data analysts. We are automatically creating depositions and authoritative copies marked with an individual digital object identifier (DOI) to maintain data integrity. We are building simple databases and supporting APIs that release the data without restrictions, in a tidy format that is easy to join with other data, or easy to join into databases, together with standardized metadata. We maintain observatory websites (see: Digital Music Observatory, Green Deal Data Observatory, Economy Data Observatory) where not only the data is available, but we provide tutorials and use cases to make it easier to use them. Our mission is to show a modern, 21st century reimagination of the data observatory concept developed and supported by the UN, EU and OECD, and we want to show that modern reproducible research and open data could make the existing 60 data observatories and the planned new ones grow faster into data ecosystems. We are working around the open collaboration concept, which is well-known in open source software development and reproducible science, but we try to make this agile project management methodology more inclusive, and include data curators, and various institutional partners into this approach. Based around our early-stage startup, Reprex, and the open-source developer community rOpenGov, we are working together with other developers, data scientists, and domain specific data experts in climate change and mitigation, antitrust and innovation policies, and various aspects of the music and film industry.

For example, various accounting, finance, legal or consulting professional standards call for appropriate documentation and record retention. 5.2 Professional Standards in Policy 5.2.1 Evidence-based, Open Policy Analysis In the last two decades, governments and researchers have placed a growing emphasis on the value of evidence-based policy. However, while the evidence generated through research to inform policy has become more rigorous and transparent, policy analysisthe process of contextualizing evidence to inform specific policy decisionsremains opaque. We believe that a modern data observatory must improve how evidence is created and used in policy reports, and pass on the efficiency gains from increasing reproducibility and automation. Therefore, we pledge that the music.dataobservatory.eu will comply with the Open Policy Analysis standards developed by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences &amp; Center for Effective Global Action.

Why The Bronx Burned. Between 1970 and 1980, seven census tracts in the Bronx lost more than 97 percent of their buildings to fire and abandonment. In his book The Fires, Joe Flood lays the blame on misguided best and brightest effort by New York City to increase government efficiency. With the help of the Rand Corp., the city tried to measure fire response times, identify redundancies in service, and close or re-allocate fire stations accordingly. What resulted, though, was a perfect storm of bad data: The methodology was flawed, the analysis was rife with biases, and the results were interpreted in a way that stacked the deck against poorer neighborhoods. The slower response times allowed smaller fires to rage uncontrolled in the citys most vulnerable communities. Listen to the podcast here Bad Incentives Are Blocking Better Science Theres a difference between an answer and a result. But all the incentives are pointing toward telling you that as soon as you get a result, you stop.

Listen to the pdocast Science is Hard here In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. Christopher Ingraham wrote a quick blog post for The Washington Post about an obscure USDA data set called the natural amenities index, which attempts to quantify the natural beauty of different parts of the country.

Make sure that you have a Zenodo account which is connected to your ORCiD ID. This enables you to publish data under your name. If you curate data for our observatories, you will be the indicators first author, and depending on what processes help you, the author of the (scientific) code that helps you calculate the values will be your co-author. Please, follow us on social media, it really helps us finding new users and showing that we are able to grow our ecosystem. Green Deal Data Observatory on Linkedin and Green Deal Data Observatory on Twitter Economy Data Observatory on Linkedin and Economy Data Observatory on Twitter Digital Music Data Observatory on Linkedin and Digital Music Data Observatory on Twitter Please send us back this md file with your data. You can open it with any text editor, but Notepad, TextEdit, Vim and similar clean text editors are the best. You can stop here if you do not have programming experience. If you do, please go on with the next steps: Without programming experience your first indicator should be uploaded manually to Zenodo, and we will help automating the new versions. This will mean, for example, the upload of a simple, csv version of an Excel table, and filling in some important information about the contents of the table. With some level of R or Python programming experience, we ask you to create a Github repo where you store your indicator. We will help you with tutorials, program codes, or applications to automate your data publication on Zenodo. In this case, make sure that you also have a Sandbox Zenodo account. There is no undo button on Zenodo. If you are tinkering with automatically publishing data, practice first in the sandbox, which is a practicing clone of Zenodo with undo button. (To avoid accidents, you need to have a completely different account with different credential on the real and the sandbox practice repository.) Experienced programmers are welcome to participate in our developer team, and become contributors, or eventually co-authors of the (scientific) software codes that we make to continuously improve our data observatories. All our data code is open source. At this level, you are expected to be able to raise and/or pick up and solve an issue in our observatorys Github repository, or its connecting statistical repositories. Our data is mainly processed in R language software, and sometimes in Python language software. If you are experienced with R bookdown, R Shiny or working in the hugo language, then you are welcome to join our developer team in non-curatorial roles. 6.2 Indicator Design We are committing ourselves in the final deliverable to follow the indicator design principles set out by Eurostat: (Eurostat 2014, 2014; Kotzeva et al. 2017) to create high-quality, validated indicators that receive appropriate feedback from users, i.e. music businesses, their trade associations and policy-makers. What are the characteristics of a good indicator? Based on the above-mentioned Eurostat expectation, we formulated it for our observatories in this way. Relevance: Indicators must meet the users needs; if they do not measure anything useful to policymakers, the public or researchers, they will probably not be widely used. Indicators should also be unambiguous in showing which direction is desirable. Accuracy and reliability: Indicators must accurately and reliably portray reality; an inaccurate indicator can lead to erroneous conclusions, steer the business or policy making process in the wrong direction or let negative effects go undetected. Timeliness and punctuality: Indicators must be released at a time that is relevant to the end user. If we cannot produce an accurate indicator in a timely manner, we should aim to create a leading indicator that is sooner available and with relatively high accuracy correlates with the indicator that is not available on time. Coherence and comparability: Indicators should be consistent internally, over time and comparable between regions and countries. This is particularly relevant for indicators used for policy monitoring and assessment, and in international business planning and assessment. Accessibility and clarity Examples for indicators in our Digital Music Observatory: Indicators that were used with all known royalty valuation methods (PwC 2008), for both authors and neighbouring rights, and fulfill the IFRS fair value standards, incorporated in EU law and the recent EU jurisprudence (InfoCuria 2014, 2017). Indicators that can be used for calculating damages, or calculating the value of the value gap (Daniel Antal 2019a, 2019c). Indicators that quantify the development needs of musicians and can set objective granting aims and grant evaluations (Dániel Antal 2015). Understanding how music is taxed, how music contributes to the local and national GDP, and how music creates jobs directly, indirectly and with induced effects (Daniel Antal 2019b). Providing detailed comparison of the differences of music audience among countries. Measuring exporting success on streaming platforms, and preparing better targeting tools. 6.2.1 Creation and Quality Control of Indicators An indicator values are created if we the data curator has some, preferably at least 20 observation values available in data table that confirms the tidy data principles, i.e. each variable is in exactly one column of the table, and each observation is in one row of the table. Each indicator should be described in a clear, English language text, describing the meaning of the variables, the source of the observations, and other important information about the processing, refreshing, extending of the dataset. We are safeguarding the quality of the indicators with various reproducible research methods. Depending on the data scientific level of the curator, we either take over the quality control mechanism, or cooperate with the curator. But the main inputs for quality control should be described by the data curator. Unit testing: Unit tests are simple, numerical test that avoid logical errors in an indicator. Shall we exclude zero values? Negative values? Do percentages must add up to 100? Some of our indicators go through more than 60 unit tests. We ask your help to get us going, and we will take care of the usual suspects: wrong currency translations, wrong decimal places (thousand, million units), etc. Missing data treatment: No real life dataset is complete, but many statistical and AI methods cannot handle missing values. Therefore, we make an effort to impute with an estimated value the missing values. Imputation is sometimes self-understanding, but sometimes it is a very tricky business, particularly when the data has several dimensions (particularly time or geographical dimension.) We want to agree with the curator because some data may be missing, and how best to handle it. For simple, two dimensional datasets, by default, we use linear approximation, forecasting and backcasting of the values, and in small datasets the last observation carry forward or the next observation carry backwards methods. May compromise the data? Let us know. Testing against peer-reviewed results: Often we know that after making various computations with a data, we must achieve an already known value. For example, the various components of the GDP in economics must add up with a pre-defined precision. Certain inputs must match a scientifically valid result. If you know of such tests, let us know, and let us include them in the unit-testing processes. Peer-reviewed data manipulation code: Whenever we re-organize, impute, or otherwise change the original data, we do it only with algorithms that went through scientific peer-review as algorithms. If there is a bug or something to improve in the way we handle the data, our code transparency makes it likely to come out. Peer-reviewed data application: We encourage our curators, particularly academics, to send the indicators created with the help of our research automation to various forms of scientific peer review, to make sure that the data is valid, useful and to bring credits to the curators. Authentic copies: We are placing each new version of the indicators values into Zenodo, a data repository that keeps authentic copies, versions, and assigns them digital object identifiers (DOIs). This makes sure that whenever our curators data is re-used, and incorrectly manipulated by a business, scientific or policy user, we can detect such manipulation. Figure 6.1: Zenodo Deposition Example You can see this dataset here, which was used in this high-profile scientific publication. 6.3 Authentic Depositions of Indicators We designed a workflow that helps our curators to put their indicator tables to Zenodo. In many cases, particularly if they do EU-funded research, this is also usually a grant requirement. At the same time, we place the indicator to our database, and make it available on our data observatorys API. With low-frequency data, such as annual data tables, we place all copies to Zenodo first, and then to the data API. In these cases, each new version of the indicator values (containing a new year, a new estimation, or a new country, a new observation unit) will have a new DOI version. With high-frequency data, such as data tables that are refreshing daily or several times a day, we do not think that authentic versioning is useful. In such cases, we create an authentic version at a pre-agreed time frequency, for example, monthly. 6.3.1 How to Add your Existing Zenodo Depositions to Our Observatory If you have a relevant dataset on Zenodo that should be featured in one of our observatories, or you are just uploading a new dataset, you should send it to our observatory communities. Communities are just collections that make your data easier to find and cite. On your new or existing deposition, go to Edit, and you will find Communities right after Files and above Upload Type. Figure 6.2: How to Add your Existing Zenodo Depositions to Our Observatory? If you want to be featured regularly in our observatories, your data should conform our database schema.

Counting plants and animals is really tricky business. The marbled murrelet is an enigma. It wasnt until the 1970s that biologists discovered where the chunky brown-and-white bird made its home, and even then it was by accident: A tree-climber found a murrelet chick at the top of a redwood. Most other bird habitats had been mapped for centuries. But who would have thought to look for a sea birds nest miles away in the middle of an old-growth forest? And its elusive. California birders can go a lifetime without seeing one. Every day at the break of dawn, the murrelet zips down from the redwood forest hills, where it lives, to the ocean, where it feeds. It then returns under the cover of darkness. Using remote acoustic sensors and machine learning to analyze the audio, biologists are now better able to track populations of species that were previously hard to monitor. With a threatened species like the marbled murrelet, that can make a huge difference. The better the data on its population and nesting patterns, the better our understanding of how its habitat is threatened, and the more effective conservation efforts can be. Figure 7.1: Soundscape of the Wedge-Tailed Shearwater from the Acoustic Metrics database Big Data Is Saving This Little Bird -listen to the interview here. The illustration is taken from Jody Avirgans blogpost. To analyze governmental, social data with ecological data, we need to place them on the same map. Biostatisticians, ecologists often work with count data  counting trees, birds, various species. We need to aggregate count data over the same maps that statisticians use to count people, measure the GDP or make environmental and urban planning. This knowledge is also very important for small area statistics that we apply in Social Attituted to Climate Change 7.3 Social Attituted to Climate Change what do people think about climate change in Europe and other parts of the world?

It provides high-quality and timely indicators in all four pillars of the planned official European Music Observatory as a modern, open source and largely open data-based, automated, API-supported alternative solution for this planned observatory. The insight and methodologies we are refining in the DMO are applicable and transferable to about 60 other data observatories funded by the EU which do not currently employ governmental or scientific open data. Music is one of the most data-driven service industries where the majority of sales are already made by AI-driven autonomous systems. We provide a template that enables making these AI-driven systems accountable and trustworthy, with the goal of re-balancing the legitimate interests of creators and consumers. Music, like all creative industries, can create high-value, human jobs in the future that utilize digital skills and human creativity. Within Europe, this new balance will be an important use case of the European Data Strategy and the Digital Services Act. The DMO places the values of the European Data Strategy at its center: our observatory model allows the seamless flow of data within the EU and across sectors; it abides by European rules concerning privacy, access, and use; it pools data from a wide range of industries and sectors and makes it available for further research. The music industry is a global industry, and the best known European music scene in the world is the British. Our observatory aims to support a new relationship between the European and the UK music industries while offering international open data products from global sources. The DMO is a fully-functional service that can function as a testing ground of the European Data Strategy, showcasing the ways in which the music industry is affected by the problems that the Digital Services Act and European Trustworthy AI initiatives attempt to regulate. Our observatorys policy insights also shed new light on important aspects of the Digital Skills and Connectivity agenda of the European Union. As a user-friendly one-stop shop for all things concerning data and the music industry, our DMO provides the foundations for a healthier and accountable European music ecosystem.

For national, gender or other market share, we need to label both music works and recorded fixations. We use various open source databases, and machine learning algorithms to do prepare the data, but eventually our data goes through human musicology or music journalist curators. For example, in our case study we were interested in the various definitions of Slovak market share, and representation of female artists. Both problems require rather challenging labeling. we tried to find a location to the artist / band [ you can describe why this is not always straightforward, for example, in the case of dead artists, etc.] our algorithm tried to guess the language of the 10 most popular song titles we checked if the person is on the Wikipedia list of Slovak male singers, Slovak female singers, Slovak bands, or their Czechoslovak versions [ who did you decide when somebody was Czechoslovak if they were Slovak] check if there was a Slovak placename mentioned on their bandcamp site check if they are associated with Slovakia on the Musicbrainz open source database if any of the artists released recodings was released in Slovakia if the majority of the artists released recordings was released in Slovakia . Until we got to the human curation. and eventually we either considered_slovak or not somebody in our write-in database. We are also developing an opt-in database, where artists can give us their own ethnic, local and gender identity, if they wish to, and of course, they can opt-out from our labeling. We are using Monte Carlo simulation and non-parametric sampling of various broadcast and music streams to get a representation of the music listened to in various cities, regions, countries, and then we apply national, language, gender, sex, locality and folksonomy tags to measure female, Slovak, Estonian, Amsterdam or Welsh market share, recommendation probability, etc. 8.5 Music &amp; Society 8.5.1 Social Attitutes to Music 8.5.2 Participation in Music "],["economy.html", "9 Economy Data Observatory 9.1 Curators 9.2 Social Attitutes to Economic Change 9.3 SME Activity Indicators 9.4 Economic Impact Indicators 9.5 Sensory Data Measuring Changes in Economic Activy", " 9 Economy Data Observatory Big data and automation create new inequalities and injustices and has a potential to create a jobless growth.

Keybase Key features Secure instant messaging, even with a timed self-destruction feature (e.g. for sharing passwords); Starts a Google Meet or Zoom video call natively with a single command; Brings your Whatsapp chat to the more private and secure keybase chat on the fly; Team chat rooms in real time. You can filter where you want to be involved, and you can always opt-out; -K-Drive (similar to OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox)  only for our team, and fully encrypted; Works with Github, and it even offers a more private version of Private Github Repos, encrypted gits; An integration with other platforms; It is neat, open source, simple, clean, and usually appreciated more in the open source community than Slack, its big corporation rival. Practical steps you need to follow to use Keybase Download &amp; install Keybase from https://keybase.io/ on your computer. An easy procedure. Create yourself a professional login name  similarly to a professional github account, a professional email, etc. (you cannot change the name afterwards) Once you log in to the computer, go to Devices, and Create a paper key. Write this on paper, or print it, and store it somewhere very safe (not near your computer). This to recover the access in case you lose access to all your devices. You can use Keybase simultaneously on multiple devices  Install Keybase on your smartphone, tablet or any other device. You will be guided through installation &amp; paired with your computer. Shall you need them, you have two recovery options: the paper key and your smartphone. If your smartphone breaks down and needs a replacement, you can add from your computer your new phone and deactivate the old one. Once you are in, look up antaldaniel. After a handshake Daniel will assist your smooth transition, help you find ways to our shared files, your projects files, and set up filters, so you are not flooded with information, while never left out, unless you choose to. Initially, we set up the following Big teams, as Keybase calls them, and we will send an invitation to join: reprexfriends for prospective team members, friends, and hoped-for-cooperation partners  partly for people we are discreetly asking to join us, or who want to know more about some of our work and cooperate with us; reprexcommunity is an open landing page for anybody, it is a public interface. If you every land there antaldaniel will take you to the appropriate, otherwise invisible team room. Each big team has four special members for a smooth transition: Daniel and Zuzana to assist you with getting familiar with Keybase, zoombot (just type !zoom to create a Zoom call with the team members present) and meetbot (that does the same with Google Meet, !meet). Daniel will gradually withdraw from some of the teams, once their support is not needed, though each team will have at least one Reprex co-founder present. We invite everybody to at least one team, but you can sign up to as many as you like, shall you find that convenient. Whenever you are in a situation you want to ignore us (e.g. because you sit in your dayjob), just do it. If you have a smartphone, we are there, separated from your Whatsapp friends, work emails, and you can always check on us. We can always send you a secure (and even encrypted) message to get in touch, if needed. However, we will never ever bother you with long emails, Whatsapp messages and other annoying things. Lets keep things short, give access to the full picture when needed, and let you find out what mix of response time, details and filters works best for you. 12.1.2 Git &amp; Github Git is a simultaneous collaboration for for any distributed team work - writing, programming, design work. Git is an open source software which makes sure that your teamwork files are always synchronized, clashes are avoided (you modify the same part of a file at the same time with Daniel.) The only hard part to move to Git is to make sure that Git properly works on your computer - it needs to be installed differently on all Linux distros, Mac OSX version all Windows versions. On Windows, you must make sure that Git is on the startup path. Once you are there, youll life will be much easier. Keybase allows the group work on encrypted documents, like business proposals simultaneously using Git synch. RStudio allows us to work simultaneously on business proposals, blog posts, templates via Git. Github is allows us to use shared folders (repositories or simply repos) where we can track changes, modify the same thing at the same time, avoid or resolve conflicting edits, assign tasks, and much more. If you do not have a github account yet, please, sign up now on github.com. Create a very professional profile. It is likely that you will use this profile for future works for decades, as Git is really becoming the norm of digital nomads, freelancers, and tech teams to work together. Github is not the only service platform that allows distributed, collaborative teamwork. It has many alternatives, for example, GitLab  dont confuse them. We use Github. dataobservatory-eu is our private repo collection and private github collaboration platform. 12.2 Basic file management If you work across different systems, like Windows 10, Mac, Linux, cloud, than you will easily get a problem with certain file names. Windows uses its own extensions, and does not like space in certain parts of the full filename. What is a filename: For example: C:\\data\\my-file.jpg has a path C:\\data\\ a filename my-file and an extension: .jpg. Paths work differently on all systems, so we try to work with relative path instead of full path. For example, all pictures used to illustrate this book are stored in the dataobservatory-eu/teambook repo (folder) and the images subfolder. Make sure that you use only relative path when you work collaboratively. The reason why we prefer markdown files is that they are platform independent, simple, clean text files, that can be translated to Windows, Mac, Linux specific files. Use filenames with snake_case_formatting_without_space.txt or snake-case-formatting-with-dash.jpg. Never use space in a filename, and if possible, avoid the use of uppercase. The extension is just information for the computer how to handle the file. An if you use an .txt extension for a markdown file, it will be still editable, but misleading. The .md extension just says that preferable open it with a Markdown Editor, like RStudio or stackedit.io. If you create new content, try to put it into one, single markdown.md or markdown.Rmd file. For complex documents, like this Teambook itself, we use separate files per chapter. To make sure that they can be kintted together into a single document, they must follow specifications. They must have the right filename Must be placed to the right folder May have a YAML header with further options (like adding a table of contents) Let the repo editor put your single file to the right place. Put your file to drafts/draft.md Make sure that the image references are now ../images/draftimages/draft_01.jpg format, where ../ tells the computer to go to the folder above drafts. 12.3 Writing, blogging 12.3.1 Markdown Markdown is a simple language, or rather a writing notation system that lets the word processor know that *italics* means italics, or **bold** means bold or ## Writing, blogging becomes a level 2 heading, and ### Markdown {#markdown} is a level 3 heading that can be referenced in the table of contents or internal hypertext links with [Jump to markdown introduction](#markdown). Markdown makes it possible that we can work on documents that will render fine in html, docs, pptx, pdf, google docs, or md for markdown files. Markdown is a markup language. But that is a too big word. It is more of a notation system for writing clear text that later can be automatically formatted. For example [Introduction to RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) creates the hypertext link Introduction to RMarkdown in html, docs, pptx, pdf, iWork Keynote, xlsx or any file format that we need to create. Markdown is very important for reproducible research and automation. It makes sure that the content and the form is fully separated. It is always the computers task to make the formatting work perfectly and beautifully. It is sometimes the computers task to fill out the document with text and numbers. It is a human task to desnbng beautiful documents, like blogposts, business proposals, research reports that are very easy to replicate automatically. Markdown is not strictly a language, and it has many flavors or notation version. The differences are usually related to the programming interface that allows the file conversion. If you are new to markdown, you can start with any flavor, the main text functions are the same. StackEdit is a wonderful tool, and we would recommend it, if it would not have been suspended from the Google Drive integration. You can try it out online. It is probably the cleanest interface to get you started. Heroku Markdown Editor integrates reasonably easily to your Google Drive. This means that you can edit our blogposts in your Google Documents. Docs to Markdown translates your Google Docs to Markdown. However, you must link your own images via a valid path. RStudio is our preferred offline application. It integrates seamlessly with Github. It is an integrated programming environment with four panels. If you use it as a markdown text editor, you can just minimize or close the programming tools. RStudio uses the Rmarkdown, a special version of markdown, where you can insert little programs in R, Python, C++, SQL, D3 or Bash scripts. For example, you can write a blogpost that retrieves data with a little program written by our musicology team from Spotify, or embeds a YouTube video, etc. The code chunks are visually separated from the proposal or blog post text, and you can ignore it if you do not yet write code.
